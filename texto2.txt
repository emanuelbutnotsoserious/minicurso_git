Lo, a sight most dire and bleak
From yon celestial perch doth speak
The earth shake, the earth quiver
As dazzling twisted pillars deliver
Thank God for space and that I'm here
The vacuum black, the last frontier
Grey snakes slither across country
Magnetizing and converging
From the ISS, ungodly high
Chaos madness, evolves below nigh
A tempest of great force and might
A storm of such unparalleled fright
The winds do howl, the rains do pour
The lightning strike, the thunder roar
The elements rage in wild excess
A spectacle of cruel finesse
Houses, cities, torn asunder
The havoc wreaked, a sight to wonder
May the lord have mercy on us all
Pray the storm which risen, thus shall fall
Trained forever to leave the ground
The ruined garden, churning clouds
Convergence be into the eye
Storm dilates and people die
Converge, converge, converge, converge
(Converge) converge, (converge) converge
(Converge) converge, (converge) storm surge
I am removed, I am a cloud
In peering down, I am endowed
Motor spirit, that brought me here
Fly to the moon, I have no fear
The twisters worm as tires burn
The screeching rims, gale force winds
The judgement day, murder tycoon
Ground control from the bird's eye view
In wind tunnels stained red with blood
All that was green to shit and mud
Morphing, twirling to single beast
Humanity, tantalizing feast
Feast on the blood of feckless
Pull the tide like a blanket
The storm is the aether
Quintessence and preacher
Aura drinker, spirit shrinker
The one true God
Vile smile, mental yolks
Nymphs, sylphs and pygmy's choke
Drink the blood, tasting Tchort
What hath God wrought?
Converge, converge, converge, converge
Converge, converge, converge, converge
Hungry, crawling fat grey rat snake
Seems faster than the speed of light
Snail trail through the green glade
Killer zig-zags and flying kites
Watching from the silence of space
At lords converging in their place
Generals destruction in wake
Combining fronts, ultimate quake
Mass destruction, challenging
Human race unravelling
Converge, converge
Verily winds converge with force
Deadly splendor over the course
Immersed in a mouse trap for land
Forever writ in nature's hand
The land doth mourn, the sea doth grieve
For loss of life, destruction seen
Verbose words fail to convey
The horrors that this storm do slay
Converge, converge, converge, converge
Converge, converge, converge, converge
